# LANLord

LAN lord is a desktop application that ensures more secure business endeavors between landlords and tenants. Essentially, tenants looking to lease properties can create accounts showcasing their financial status and reliability. 

Things such as their income, credit scores, past properties, how often they paid their rent on time, so on and so forth. If they find a property they are interested in; they can reach out to a landlord, the landlord can request their information, and make sure that the individuals they are communicating with are trustworthy. 

As a result, things such as scam tenants could be easily avoided. 

We used WPF, a c# markup language to create the UI, and set up a database to save user information.
