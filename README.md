# LANLord

### LAN lord is a desktop application that ensures more secure business endeavors between landlords and tenants. Essentially, tenants looking to lease properties can create accounts showcasing their financial status and reliability. Things such as their income, credit scores, past properties, how often they paid their rent on time, so on and so forth. If they find a property they are interested in; they can reach out to a landlord, the landlord can request their information, and make sure that the individuals they are communicating with are trustworthy. As a result, things such as scam tenants could be easily avoided. 

### Frequently, scam tenants can quickly get away with squatting in their leased properties and not paying a dime, leaving landlords with an insurmountable amount of mental and financial problems. The idea behind this application is that if we can produce a better picture of the past experiences tenants have with previous landlords, we can avoid things like squatting and scamming in the real estate world, ensuring a safer environment for our fellow LAN lords.

### We used WPF, a c# markup language to create the UI, and set up a database to save user information.
